======

Binary patching tools using rsync algorithm and LZMA.

Only works with Windows by now.

Might be buggy, so before delete the original file, CHECK MD5 for the patched result to see everything get right!

Created with Visual Studio 2010(R)

Check the Release folder for a precompiled executable.
